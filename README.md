## N-Queens
The N Queens is the problem of placing N chess queens on an NÃ—N chessboard so that no two queens attack each other.
## Hill Climbing
Hill climbing algorithm is a local search algorithm which continuously moves in the direction of increasing elevation/value to find the peak of the mountain or best solution to the problem.
## My Code
Python Implementation for solving N-Queen problem using Hill Climbing with random restart
#### Input
```javascript
How many queens? 4
```
#### Output

```javascript
Initial State:  [2, 1, 3, 0]
Local Optimal:  [2, 1, 3, 3]
Random Restart

Start again:  [0, 2, 1, 3]
Local Optimal:  [0, 2, 1, 2]
Random Restart

Start again:  [2, 3, 0, 1]
Local Optimal:  [1, 3, 0, 3]
Global Optimal Solution:  [1, 3, 0, 2]


```
